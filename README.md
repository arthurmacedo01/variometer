## Overview

The **Altitude Monitoring and Alert System** is designed to provide precise altitude measurements and corresponding alerts based on vertical velocity. It is ideal for applications such as drone flight control, hiking altimeters, or any system requiring accurate altitude and movement tracking.

The system reads pressure data from the BMX280 sensor, converts it to altitude, and processes it through a Kalman Filter to obtain smooth and accurate estimates of altitude, velocity, and acceleration. Based on the estimated velocity, the buzzer produces sound signals with varying frequencies, providing immediate auditory feedback on the vertical movement.

### Kalman Filter Explanation

The Kalman Filter is an efficient recursive filter that estimates the state of a dynamic system from a series of incomplete and noisy measurements. In this project, it is used to estimate:

    Altitude (x1)
    Vertical Velocity (x2)
    Vertical Acceleration (x3)

## Kalman Filter Steps

    Prediction Step:
        Predicts the next state (x_hat_pred) based on the previous state and a dynamic model.
        Predicts the error covariance (P_pred) of the estimate.

    Update Step:
        Incorporates new measurements to correct the predicted state.
        Calculates the Kalman Gain (K) which determines the weight given to the new measurements.
        Updates the state estimate (x_hat) and error covariance (P).

## Parameters

    Sampling Time (T): Time interval between measurements (100 ms).
    Process Noise Covariance (Q1, Q2, Q3): Represents the uncertainty in the model.
    Measurement Noise Covariance (R): Represents the uncertainty in the measurements.
    Initial Error Covariance (P11, P12, ..., P33): Represents the initial uncertainty in the state estimates.

## Benefits

    Noise Reduction: Provides smooth estimates by filtering out sensor noise.
    Predictive Capability: Can predict future states, useful for proactive alerting.
    Adaptive: Automatically adjusts estimates based on measurement accuracy.

### Usage

Once the system is set up and running:

    Power On: Connect and power up the ESP32 board.
    Monitoring: Use the serial monitor to observe real-time data, including current pressure, altitude, and estimated states.
    Auditory Alerts:
        Ascending: The buzzer emits higher-frequency sounds when ascending.
        Descending: The buzzer emits lower-frequency sounds when descending.
        Stationary: The buzzer remains silent or emits a baseline frequency within the defined dead band.

## Configurable Parameters

    DEAD_BAND: Threshold for minimal velocity below which the buzzer remains silent.
    SENSIBILITY: Factor determining how much the buzzer frequency changes with velocity.
    Sampling Time (T): Adjust for faster or slower
